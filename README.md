## Data Structs and Functions

### Structs:	
    
    mutable struct ChannelParam      # this structure contains all the relevant EDF-signal parameters of one signal
        label::String                  # label (name) of the signal, eg "C4" if in 10-20 labeling terms
        transducer::String             # signal transducer type
        physdimension::String          # physical dimension (uV, bpm, mA, etc.)
        physmax::Float64               # physical maximum, usually the maximum input of the ADC
        physmin::Float64               # physical minimum, usually the minimum input of the ADC
        digmax::Int                    # digital maximum, usually the maximum output of the ADC, cannot be higher than 32767 for EDF or 8388607 for BDF
        digmin::Int                    # digital minimum, usually the minimum output of the ADC, cannot be lower than -32768 for EDF or -8388608 for BDF
        smp_per_record::Int            # number of samples of this signal in a datarecord
        prefilter::String              # channel prefiltering settings if any
        reserved::String               # header reserved ascii text, 32 bytes
        offset::Float64                # offset of center of physical data value from center of digital values
        bufoffset::Int                 # bytes from start of record to start of this channel (zero for first channel)
        bitvalue::Float64              # physical data value of one unit change in digital value
        annotation::Bool               # true if is an annotation not a binary mapped signal data channel
        ChannelParam() = new("","","",0.0,0.0,0,0,0,"","",0.0,0,0.0,false)
    end

Parameters for each channel in the EEG record.
<br /><br /><br />

    mutable struct Annotation
        onset::Float64
        duration::String
        annotation::Array{String,1}
        Annotation() = new(0.0,"",[])
        Annotation(o,d,arr) = new(o, d, typeof(arr) == String ? [arr] : arr)
    end

These are text strings within the file denoting a time, optionally duration, and a list of notes
about the signal at that particular time in the recording. The first onset time
of the annotation channel gives a fractional second offset adjustment of the
start time of that record, which is specified in whole seconds in the header.

    end

Data struct for EDF, EDF+, BDF, and BDF+ EEG type signal files.
<br /><br /><br />

    DataFormat

enum for types this package handles. Current format for a potential translation is also /same/.
<br /><br /><br />

    FileStatus

enum for type or state of file: type of data detected, whether any errors
<br /><br /><br />

### Functions:

    loadfile(path::String, read_annotations=true)

Load a BDF+ or EDF+ type file.
Takes a pathname. Will ignore annotations if second argument is set false.
Returns a BEDFPlus structure including header and data.
<br /><br /><br />


    writefile!(edfh, newpath; acquire=dummyacquire, sigformat=same)

Write to data in the edfh struct to the file indicated by newpath
Returns the file handle of the file written, opened for reading
NOTE: The header needs to be completely specified at function start except for
the final number of records, which will be updated after all data records
are written. For a system that is recording the data as it is written, the
acquire(edfh) function should write the data according the the header parameters.
Note that if the function converts from BDF to EDF or EDF to BDF, the edfh struct is changed.
<br /><br /><br />


    epoch_iterator(edfh, epochsecs; channels, startsec, endsec, physical)

Make an iterator for EEG epochs of a given duration between start and stop times.
Required arguments:

- edfh: BEDFPlus struct
- epochsecs: second duration of each epoch

Optional arguments:

- channels: List of channel numbers for data, defaults to all signal channels
- startsec: Starting position from 0 at start of file, defaults to file start
- endsec: Ending position in seconds from start of _file_, defaults to file end
- physical: Whether to return data as translated to the physical units, defaults to true
<br /><br /><br />


    annotation_epoch_iterator(edfh, epochsecs; startsec, endsec)

Return an iterator for a group of annotations for a given epoch as in epoch_iterator
<br /><br /><br />
